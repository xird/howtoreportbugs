    <h2>At the very least, report three (3) things:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>What did you do?</li>
      <li>What did you expect to happen?</li>
      <li>What actually happened?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>That's it. Really, as simple as that.</strong></p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <h3>Example 1</h3>

    <p><em>Bad:</em> "I can't log in"</p>

    <p><em>Good:</em> "I went to example.com, entered my credentials in the login form, and pressed enter. Instead of being logged in, I got an error message saying 'internal server error'."</p>

    <h3>Example 2</h3>

    <p><em>Bad:</em> "The web radio stream isn't working"</p>

    <p><em>Good:</em> "I'm trying to listen to the web radio on my iPhone with the exampleRadio app. When I click on Groovy Web Radio on the front page, the app crashes."</p>

    <h3>Example 3</h3>

    <p><em>Bad:</em> "I can't save my document"</p>

    <p><em>Good:</em> "I have a document open in Microsoft Word. I'm then trying to save. I select the N: network drive, and name the document myexample.docx. When I click on the Save button, I get an 'Access denied' error. "</p>

    <h2>Optional things to report</h2>

    <p>As the examples above show, it is quite often helpful to include more information, in addition to the three required things. Such additional information can include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The operating system used (Windows, MacOS, Linux)</li>
      <li>The device used (laptop computer, smart phone, tablet)</li>
      <li>What software was being used (a stand-alone application, a web browser, a mobile app)</li>
      <li>Any error messages returned</li>
      <li>Any screenshots available</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While these additional details are not always required, they can help the recipient of the bug report to pinpoint the problem.</p>
